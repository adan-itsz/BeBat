At under 80KB (minified), it provides a simple way to produce common types of graphics in a principled and consistent way. The library currently supports line charts, scatterplots, histograms, bar charts and data tables, as well as features like rug plots and basic linear regression.\n\nA sample set of examples may be found on [the examples page](http://metricsgraphicsjs.org). The example below demonstrates how easy it is to produce a graphic. Our graphics function provides a robust layer of indirection, allowing one to more efficiently build, say, a dashboard of interactive graphics, each of which may be pulling data from a different data source. For the complete list of options, and for download instructions, [take a look at the sections below](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki).\n\n```js\nMG.data_graphic({\n    title: 'Downloads',\n    description: 'This graphics shows Firefox GA downloads for the past six months.',\n    data: downloads_data, // an array of objects, such as [{value:100,date:...},...]\n    width: 600,\n    height: 250,\n    target: '#downloads', // the html element that the graphic is inserted in\n    x_accessor: 'date',  // the key that accesses the x value\n    y_accessor: 'value' // the key that accesses the y value\n})\n```\n\nThe API is simple. All that's needed to create a graphic is to specify a few default parameters and then, if desired, override one or more of the [optional parameters on offer](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/List-of-Options). We don't maintain state. In order to update a graphic, one would call _MG.data_graphic_ on the same target element.\n\nThe library is data-source agnostic. While it provides a number of convenience functions and options that allow for graphics to better handle things like missing observations, it doesn't care where the data comes from.\n\nThough originally envisioned for Mozilla Metrics dashboard projects, we are making this repository public for other to use, knowing full well that we are far from having this project in good-enough shape. Take a look at the issues to see the milestones and other upcoming work on this repository. We are currently using semantic versioning.\n\n<a href=\"http://metricsgraphicsjs.org\">http://metricsgraphicsjs.org</a>\n\n## Important changes in v2.10\nThe library now depends on D3 4.x. The impact on MG users is minimal, though if you do use D3 for other work, here is the [list of changes](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md) from 3.x to 4.x. Please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/releases/tag/v2.10.0) for further details.\n\n## Important changes in v2.0\n1. The library is now namespaced. ``data_graphic`` is now ``MG.data_graphic``, ``convert_dates`` is now ``MG.convert.date``, ``clone`` is now ``MG.clone``, ``button_layout`` is now ``MG.button_layout`` and ``data_table`` is now ``MG.data_table``. We added a new convenience function called ``MG.convert.number``.\n2. The ``rollover_callback`` option has been renamed ``mouseover`` and expanded in order to make it more consistent with other libraries. We now have three callback functions available: [mouseover](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/Graphic#mouseover), [mouseout](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/Graphic#mouseout) and [mousemove](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/Graphic#mousemove).\n3. CSS rules have been prefixed and in some cases updated for consistency. ``active_datapoint`` for instance is now ``mg-active-datapoint``.\n\n## Quick-start guide\n1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/releases).\n2. Follow the examples [here](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/blob/master/examples/index.htm) and [here](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/blob/master/examples/js/main.js) to see how graphics are laid out and built. The examples use JSON data from [examples/data](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/blob/master/examples/data), though you may easily pull data from elsewhere.\n\n## Dependencies\nThe library depends on [D3](http://d3js.org). If you wish to enable tooltips or use [buttons](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/Button-Layout), please include [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) as well. Versions of MG older than v2.10 depend on D3 3, whereas MG v2.10 onwards depend on D3 4.\n\n## Contributing\nIf you would like to help extend MetricsGraphics.js or fix bugs, please [fork the library](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics) and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Then, from the project's root directory install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com):\n\n    npm install gulp\n\nThen, install the library's dependencies:\n\n    npm install\n\nTo build the library from source, type:\n\n    gulp build:js\n\nTo run tests, type:\n\n    gulp test\n\nTo run the development server (accessible at http://localhost:4300):\n\n    gulp serve\n\nYou might also be interested in writing addons for the library, in which case, [have a read through this page](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/Developing-Addons).\n\n## Resources\n* [Examples](http://metricsgraphicsjs.org/examples.htm)\n* [Interactive demo](http://metricsgraphicsjs.org/interactive-demo.htm)\n* [List of options](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/List-of-Options)\n* [Convenience functions](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/Convenience-Functions)\n* [Hooks](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/blob/master/HOOKS.md)\n* [Chart types](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/Chart-Types)\n* [Developing addons](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/Developing-Addons)\n* [Building a button layout](https://github.com/mozilla/metrics-graphics/wiki/Button-Layout)\n\n## Download package\nThe download package includes everything that you see on [metricsgraphicsjs.org](http://metricsgraphicsjs.org). In order to use the library in your own project, the only files that you'll need are the ones under ``dist``. Remember to load ``D3`` and ``jQuery``. If you don't care about tooltips or the button layout, you won't need the latter. If your project uses Bootstrap, make sure you load MetricsGraphics.js after it.\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n__What does MetricsGraphics.js do that library x doesn't do?__\n\nIf library x works for you, you should keep using it. We're not aiming to be competitive with libraries that already exist. We're aiming to make a library that meets our needs. We also happen to think that the world _needs_ a principled data presentation library, and that many of our needs are the same as other folks'.\n\n__I only see the first five lines in my chart, what gives?__\n\nThe colors for the first five lines, areas and legends are defined in the stylesheet for the light and dark themes. For a sixth line, you would add the follow CSS rules:\n\n\n```css\n.mg-line6-color {\n    stroke: steelblue;\n}\n\n.mg-area6-color {\n    fill: steelblue;\n}\n\n.mg-hover-line6-color {\n    fill: steelblue;\n}\n\n.mg-line6-legend-color {\n    color: steelblue;\n}\n```\n\nIf you're plotting more than five lines in the same chart and using _color_ to encode some dimension of the data, then you probably need to rethink the chart.\n\n__I get an error when I load MG alongside library x__\n\nIf your project uses Bootstrap, make sure you load MetricsGraphics.js after it. If your project uses jQuery UI, load it after MetricsGraphics.js.\n\n## Gallery\nFeel free to add your addons and websites to this list.\n* [mg-color-scale (addon)](https://github.com/dandehavilland/mg-color-scale)\n* [mg-line-brushing (addon)](https://github.com/dandehavilland/mg-line-brushing)\n* [mg-regions (addon)](https://github.com/senseyeio/mg-regions)\n* [Rails wrapper gem](https://github.com/dgilperez/metrics-graphics-rails)\n* [R package (htmlwidget)](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/metricsgraphics)\n* [Python library - using Pyxley](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/07/16/pyxley)\n* [Angular directive](https://github.com/elmarquez/angular-metrics-graphics)\n* [React component](https://github.com/cf/react-metrics-graphics)\n\n## License\n\nThe __MetricsGraphics.js__ code is shared under the terms of the [Mozilla Public License v2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/).
